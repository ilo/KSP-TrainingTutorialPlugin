KSP-TrainingTutorialPlugin
==========================

A simple tutorial on how to create training plugins for Kerbal Space Program
Based on: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/121-Writing-Tutorials-A-Demo-(and-some-source-code)

Installation
============

Copy the main project in the Kerbal Space Program root folder. All the references in the project (including Unity and KSP dll files) are using relative paths, so there is no need to change them. 

After that you should have: /.. whatever ../Kerbal Space Project/KSP-TrainingTutorialPlugin-master/

When the project is built, all required files are copied in the corresponding game folders. Just go to Training in the game menu and you will find the new tutorial there.
